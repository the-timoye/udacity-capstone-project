Udacity's Data Engineering Capstone Project

## THE PROBLEM
A company decides to analyse the US immigration database to check student immigrants. The following are examples of questions they need answers to through their analysis:
    - What are the age ranges of non-immigrant students?
    - How long fo these students stay in the US?
    - What is the ration of male to female genders per year?
    - How many students leave the States at the expected year?
The company would also like to have answers to questioins like:
    - What are the countries of residents of these immigrants, and the major race of people in the states they would be residing?
    - What cities get the most student immigrants? Population and most popular race in those cities?


## SOLUTION
The goal of this project is to ensure the right data is gathered for a successfuk analysis by the team. Data Engineering tools like pandas, Amazon Redshift, Spark will be used for exploration, storage and manupilation of data. Each step will be discussed below.

## DATA IDENTIFICATION AND GATHERING
To compute these analysis, datasets will be downloaded from the immigration and US Citites demography websites (link below).
